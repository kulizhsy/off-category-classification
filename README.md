# OFF Category Classification

This repository contains the code to train a multi-label category classifier for Open Food Facts products.

It works within Robotoff (https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff), currently using product_name and ingredients_tags.
A Data 4 Good to add more features to the model has been initiated (https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/DataForGood-2022). You can find things to help with at https://github.com/openfoodfacts/off-category-classification/issues/2
